# Automated-Plate-Delivery-Machine
> ** A Vision-Based Mobile Manipu;ator for Autonomous Service**
**Current Status:** Hardware Deployed on Jetson Nano
* Validated mechanical design and YOLOv8 model performance.
* Transitioned the computing core from **Raspberry Pi 4** to **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** to address computational bottlenecks encourntered during YOLOv8-based object detection.
* Achieved plate-grabbing action by integrating YOLOv8 object detection model and self-designed robotic arm.
